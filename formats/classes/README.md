you need to generate the XML classes yourself or pull them from HKX2 in dsmapstudio/dsanimstudio. i will not be providing the XML, though I will provide the generator script as well as the generated class files.

the XML should be in the reference folder with the following name scheme:
	DS3: classxmlds3/
	everything else: (Not supported yet)

basically just like how it is in HKX2. I do have a reference copy of the XML should anything happen to the current repos. worst case i add in a dumping script so we can dump the classes manually or with a script.
