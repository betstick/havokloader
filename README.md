## C Havok Loader
A simple Havok file loader written in modern C. Primarily for loading Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition data. Based heavily on the work of Katalashm, PredatorCZ, and SeanPesce. More support depends on if I feel like it.

# Info
Why C? I like it. It's simple and should be somewhat portable. Though right now only x86_64 is supported. ARM support could be added pretty easily though with some macros to ensure byte consistency.
