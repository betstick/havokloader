## C++ Havok Loader
A simple Havok file loader written in modern C++. Primarily for loading Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition data. Based heavily on the work of Katalash, PredatorCZ, and SeanPesce. Go check out their Githubs to see some cool work.

More support depends on if I feel like it. Also if someone can get XML dumps of the rest of the Havok versions. Most of the C++ code here is built by the autogenerator Python script.

# Info
Why C++? I like it. It's simple and should be somewhat portable. Though right now only x86_64 is supported. ARM support could be added pretty easily though with some macros to ensure byte consistency.
